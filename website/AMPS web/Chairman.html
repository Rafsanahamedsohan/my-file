        </div>
        <p>Abdullah Model Public School started its journey in 2000 with the slogan “Education for Humanization”. The motto of this institution is to make the students worthy citizens and able leaders to serve the country and the world community. Besides academic programmes, we do duly emphasize on curricular and co-curricular activities to explore their hidden talents. Our efforts are also directed to ensure their sound state of mind and body.It really gives me immense pleasure to learn that the students of Abdullah Model Public School & College are groomed with digital contents and well acquainted with the ICT devices to face the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>I wish Abdullah Model Public School & College will keep up its tempo of excellence in the years to come. </p>
